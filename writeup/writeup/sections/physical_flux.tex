\section{Physical Fluxes}
In order to compute the FHLL fluxes at each of the boundaries, I need to compute the physical fluxes for each of the time averaged conserved quantities in each cell, as prescribed by the euler equations. Then I can use these physical fluxes to compute the fluxes of the left and right states and then compute the FHLL flux at each boundary.
