\section{Physical Fluxes}
\subsection{Nonrelativistic Fluxes}
We can compute the physical fluxes from the expressions for the fluxes as a function of the conserved variables and primitive variables. The physical fluxes are given from the euler equations by:
$$F = \begin{bmatrix} \rho v\\ \rho v^2 +p \\ (E+p)v \end{bmatrix}$$
After retrieving the primitives from the conserved variables, we can compute the physical fluxes for each of the physical cells. 
\subsection{Relativistic Fluxes}
In the relativistic case, we build the physical fluxes out of the new conserved variables.
$$F=(D v , Sv + p , S - D v )^T$$
