\section{Eigenvalues}
In order to implement the FHLL flux, it was necessary to compute the minimal and maximal eigenvalues of the jacobians of the left and right states. 
\subsection{Nonrelativistic Case}
In the nonrelativistic case, we can compute the minimal and maximumal eigenvalues of the left and right states in order to compute the numerical flux:
$$\alpha^{\pm}=\max(0,\pm\lambda^{\pm}(\bm{U}^L),\pm\lambda^{\pm}(\bm{U}^R))$$
For the nonrelativistic case, it can be shown that the minimal and maximal eigenvalues are given by:
$$\lambda^{\pm}=v\pm c_s$$
Where $c_s$ is the nonrelativistic sound speed. 
\subsection{Relativistic Case}
For the relativistic case in one dimension, the minimal and maximal eigenvalues correspond to their relativistic counterpart via the einstein summation formula:
$$\lambda^{\pm}=\frac{v\pm c_s}{1\pm v c_s}$$
