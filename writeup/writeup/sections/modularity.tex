\section{Modularity}
I took great lengths to improve the modular structure of my code. As a result of this, it is possible for me in the future to implement more versions of approximate riemann solvers, more varied test cases, as well as several dimensions. This provides the structure in order to perform a more inclusive comparison between different combinations of higher order methods in different scenarios.
