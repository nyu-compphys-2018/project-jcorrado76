\section{Numerical Flux}

Once I have computed the physical fluxes, I can solve the riemann problem at each of the boundaries using a high resolution shock capturing approximate riemann solver. In this case, I used the HLL approximate riemann solver for special relativistic hydrodynamical simulations.
