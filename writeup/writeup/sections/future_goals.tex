\section{ Future Goals}

In the future, I hope to be able to increase the dimensionality of my code to 2D
in order to investigate phenomena that arise once one goes to higher dimension. In addition, I would like to implement other approximate riemann solvers, as well as different reconstruction methods in order to compare how well they represent the solution for different situations.
