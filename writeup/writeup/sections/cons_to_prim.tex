\section{Retrieving the Primitives from the Conserved Variables}
In order to compute the numerical FHLL flux, I needed to recover the primitive variables from the conserved ones at least once per iteration. For the nonrelativistic case, this was easy because the expressions for recovering the primitive variables can be derived in a straightforward manner from the euler equations. Conversely, for the relativistic case, retrieving the primitives becomes slightly more complicated, as it involved iterating over a nonlinear root-finding algorithm in order to retrieve one of the primitives, which I then used to compute the remaining missing ones.
